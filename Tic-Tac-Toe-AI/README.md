# 🎮 Tic-Tac-Toe AI — CODING SAMURAI INTERNSHIP TASK

This project is part of the **CODING SAMURAI Internship Task**.

## 📌 Project Description

An interactive **Tic-Tac-Toe** game built in **Python** where a human player competes against an **unbeatable AI** opponent powered by the **Minimax algorithm**. The AI calculates all possible game outcomes to make the best possible move.

## 🚀 Features

- Turn-based terminal gameplay
- AI uses the **Minimax algorithm** for optimal strategy
- Win/draw detection logic
- Beginner-friendly code

## 🧠 Skills Demonstrated

- Python programming
- Game development logic
- Artificial Intelligence (Minimax algorithm)
- Recursive problem solving

## ▶️ How to Run

1. Make sure Python is installed
2. Open terminal in the project folder
3. Run:

```bash
python tic_tac_toe_ai.py
